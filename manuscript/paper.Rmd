# Introduction

-   importance of reproducibility
-   As a case on point ...?
-   Underscores the importance of reproducibility within the frame of
    statistical analysis. We use the study by to ... The current study
    builds on the paper by .. and starts in the manner of a replication
    study and extends the analyses therein. We focus on statistical
    analyses of these data and compare models based on varied
    specification of functional forms of the covariates.

# Methods

## Study population

Data utilized in this paper is sourced from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a comprehensive nationwide survey
administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) via the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The survey assesses
the health and nutrition of the entire non-institutionalized US
population, spanning all ages and residing in all 50 states as well as
Washington D.C. As such, the survey provides a cross-sectional view of a
representative sample of the US population. Further information about
NHANES can be found at www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.

## Data

Our current analyses combine the 2015 - 2018 NHANES survey cycles to
yield $n = 19225$ observations on 35 covariates. This sample size was
comprised $n = 9971$ and $n = 9254$ observations from the 2015/2016 and
2017/2018 survey cycles, respectively. Analyses excluded individuals
with missing data on sleep ($n = 6818$), blood pressure (BP) (n = 1055),
and body mass index (BMI) or those with BMI \> 25 kg/$m^2$ (overweight)
(n = 5521). Individuals that reported being on anti-hypertensive
medication were also excluded from further analyses (n = 2944).

### Outcome definition:

We defined our outcome as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These
variables are measured by trained examiners using standardized
procedures. Given that systolic and diastolic blood pressure
measurements are taken at least four times on an individual, our
definition of these outcome is based on an average of the first three
blood pressure measurements.

### Exposure:

Sleep duration on workdays was evaluated by the questionnaire with the
following questions: "Number of hours usually sleep on weekdays or
workdays". Sleep duration was divided into three groups, which were \< 6
h, 6--8 h, ≥ 8 h respectively, of which 6--8 h was used as the reference
group.

### Covariates:

In addition to the exposure and outcome variables, our analyses included
the following as covariates: Race divided into four groups as Mexican
American, white, black and other race. Alcohol consumption was grouped
into drinking, no drinking, not recorded. Smoking status as smoking, not
smoking, not recorded. Diabetes was defined as yes, no, borderline, or
not recorded. Hypertension was defined as yes, no, or not recorded.
Snorting was defined as yes, no, and not recorded. US citizenship status
was defined as citizen by birth or naturalization, don't know, not a
citizen, or refused to answer. Education level was grouped into four
categories including graduate studies, high school, less than grade 12
or some college. Additional covariates included marital status, gender,
age, albumin, creatinine,hemoglobin, total cholesterol (TC), aspertate
aminotransferase (AST), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and body mass
index (BMI). Details about these variables can be found at
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/default.aspx>. Age, albumin,
creatinine, hemoglobin, TC, AST, HDL, and BMI were analyzed as
continuous variables whereas gender, alcohol consumption, diabetes,
smoking, race, hypertension, and snorting were analyzed as categorical
variables. Table \@ref{tab:tabone} highlights the variable names and
descriptions as utilized in this study.

```{r tabone, echo=FALSE}
#tab.one <- as_kable_extra(vars, caption = "Variable names and descriptions", 
#                 format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
#  kable_styling(latex_options = c("HOLD_position") %>% 
#  row_spec(c(0), bold = TRUE) %>% 
#  column_spec(c(1, 2), bold = TRUE, width = "2cm") %>% 
#  column_spec(3, width = "8cm")
#tab.one


vars %>% kable(booktabs = T) %>% kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")


```

## Statistical modeling

In order to select variables impacting blood pressure, we proceed by
doing some variable selection with regularization techniques. We first
employ best subset selection by using 10-fold cross validation to select
the best number of subsets. For syastolic blood pressure, forward best
subset selection choose 13 variables and for diastolic blood pressure 19
variables. These variables are showed, along with its significance in
Table \@ref(tab:tabreg)

```{r tabref, echo=FALSE}
tab.ref %>% as_kable_extra(booktabs = T, caption ="Coefficients for Foward Best Subset Selection") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")

```

# Results

Table \@ref(tab:tabtwo) summarizes participant characteristics in the
2015 - 2018 NHANES survey cycles stratified by gender. Among the
participants, the proportion of males and females were 44.81% (n = 1378)
and 55.19% (n = 1509), respectively. With ethnicity, the proportion of
Mexican American, White and Black were 6.27%, 64.62% and 9.94%,
respectively. Overall, the mean (SD) values for age, albumin,
creatinine, SBP, DBP, hemoglobin, TC, AST, HDL, BMI were 38.54 (17.72)
years, 43.48 (3.58) g/L, 73.21 (19.73) umol/L, 115.33 (14.56) mmHg,
68.47 (10.08) mmHg, 14.07(1.44)g/dL, 4.67 (1.01) mmol/L, 23.18 (13.01)
IU/L, 1.59 (0.43) mmol/L, and 21.97(2.06) kg/m2, respectively. Among the
participants, 66.01% were consumed alcohol drinkers, 2.61% were
diabetes, 3.16% were hypertension, 6.72% have snort or stop breathing.
17.99% were smokers. Sleep duration was divided into three groups, which
were \< 6 h, 6--8 h, ≥ 8 h, each with a proportion of 6.26%, 40.53%,
53.21%, respectively.

Male and female participants differed significantly on characteristics
